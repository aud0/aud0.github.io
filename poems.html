            I don't believe in fate,
            I believe in luck
            I believe that I am
            So lucky
            To have found you

            I believe in statistics
            I believe that there's so many people
            on bumble
            That at lesat one of them has to be 
            amazing

            I believe that I am so lucky to have found you
            That statistics say that
            There has to be a good one out there
            But luck 
            is what led me to you 

            You feel like a soft pillow
            And I feel like I'm falling 
            into you 
            Please catch me
            I could still break
            At
            Any
            Time

            The first thing you do
            When going on a ride 
            Is put your seatbelts on
            You never know
            When you might crash
            Hold tight

            The first thing I did
            When I met you
            Was put on my metaphorical seatbelt 
            When you crash
            Your view gets hazy
            And I wanted to make sure 
            It was 20/20

            I don't think I'm a vehicle
            That can travel through
            All the mediums
            And when I met you
            I felt like I was fire
            And you were water 
            And the ocean
            Between us
            Was too wide
            To bridge

            When I first met you
            You felt like
            A new car
            I wanted
            Not quite
            The comfort
            I needed
            But so lovely
            I couldn't help
            But stay

            I think
            I thought
            This hill was 
            Too high to clmb
            The first part 
            Felt so slow
            As I was figuring out
            Which gear to shift to

            The first part
            I had my foot hovering
            Over the break
            Ready to call it
            At any time

            I think I'm at the top now
            I think I'm about to dive in
            Headfirst
            Down this hill
            
            I can feel the wheels turning
            And the speed reving up
            I can feel
            My heart beating

            I'm letting go of the breaks
            I'm looking out of the window

            It looks
            So beautiful
            Fuck
            It's going to be a hell of a ride
            And I don't have
            My helmet on
            I think 
            The airbags
            Are broken too 
            But the view
            Looks so beautiful
            It's gonna be
            A hell of a time
            And I'm just going to
            Enjoy it
        </p>

            Hey you,
            I hope you're having a great time
            That the warmth engulfs you
            And the sun glows
            In the morning dew

            I hope your tea is black
            So you can hear the cumdown track
            Back to back

            Up and then down,
            There's twelve hours between us,
            Oceans we can't swim
            But mouths that won't frown

            Hey you,
            I'm counting the days,
            But for every second you're away
            There's more days we'll have to stay

            Hey you,
            I love you
            Come back to me, yeah?
        </p>
